# Dotfiles

These are my Dotfiles. Most of these I copied from somewhere else.

## Prerequisites

### Components
- Install powerline patched fonts.

### Programs
zsh
nvim
tmux
starship
kitty (if applicable)

## Initial steps
- After starting tmux first time, make sure to press `prefix + I` to install stuff.
- The rest do work by itself, I would think.
